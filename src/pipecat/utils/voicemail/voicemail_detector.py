class VoicemailDetector(ParallelPipeline):
    """Parallel pipeline for detecting voicemail vs. live conversation in outbound calls.

    This detector uses a parallel pipeline architecture to perform real-time
    classification of outbound phone calls without interrupting the conversation
    flow. It determines whether a human answered the phone or if the call went
    to a voicemail system.

    Architecture:

    - Conversation branch: Empty pipeline that allows normal frame flow
    - Classification branch: Contains the LLM classifier and decision logic

    The system uses a gate mechanism to control when classification runs and
    a buffering system to prevent TTS output until classification is complete.
    Once a decision is made, the appropriate action is taken:

    - CONVERSATION: Continue normal bot dialogue
    - VOICEMAIL: Trigger developer callback for custom voicemail handling

    Example::

        classification_llm = OpenAILLMService(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

        async def handle_voicemail(processor):
            await processor.push_frame(TTSSpeakFrame("Please leave a message."))

            llm=classification_llm,
            on_voicemail_detected=handle_voicemail
        )

        pipeline = Pipeline([
